# AppPackage
A package of python apps.

# How to Run (Important)
To run AppPackage open 'AppPackage.py' in the AppPackage folder. The main program allows you to easily search and run any program and at the end of the program it will run the main AppPackage program again if you would like to run another program. Recommended for convenience.

NOTE: Use lowercase when typing a program's name even though the program name has a capital letter(s).
