# AppPackage
A package of python apps. (I didn't take any random python scripts from anyone else. I added my own and people are free to add their own scripts here too.)

# How to Run (Important)
To run AppPackage open 'AppPackage.py' in the AppPackage folder. The main program allows you to easily search and run any program and at the end of the program it will run the main AppPackage program again if you would like to run another program. Recommended for convenience.

NOTE: Use lowercase when typing a program's name even though the program name has a capital letter(s).

# Contribution
Feel free to add your own python scripts (it has to be made by you) in the AppPackage folder and I will check them out and decide whether to add or not. If a program similar to your program has already been added but yours is better, make the already existing program better.
